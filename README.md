## How To Use This Repo

`DXF_FILES/`  
In this directory you will find the .DXF files that are ready to be sent to a manufacturing service.

`PICS/`  
Just random pictures that might help visualize the design before opening any files.

`<PROJECT_NAME> <PROJECT_VERSION_NUMBER>.f3z`  
This is the Fusion360 file that will give you a full copy of the original design including the timeline history which allows you to edit any feature as needed! You can also use this file to export any other file formats that aren't in this repo. Go crazy!!!!

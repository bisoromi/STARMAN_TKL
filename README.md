# STARMAN ACRYLIC
Open source files for Starman acrylic version which is part of the "Starman" series of mechanical keyboards created by me. The Starman series features a stepless adjustable angle which starts from zero degrees and can go as high as you can feasibly make it (With a long enough rod). The angle is adjusted by turning the knob on top of the keyboard either clockwise to increase the angle, or counter-clockwise to lower the angle.

**Starman Acrylic** - Stacked Acrylic TKL  
**Starman** - Aluminum TKL  
**Starman Junior** - Aluminum 60%
